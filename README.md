## torchlearning-benchmark
This repository is designed for generalized supervised learning tasks on PyTorch based on maskrcnn-benchmark. torchlearning-benchmark provides complete support for supervised learning pipeline including:
+ Data set registry, managing and building 
+ Learning and testing on multiple data set simultaneously
+ Complete customize options for data sampler, batch sampler, collate function in data loader
+ Data transform registry, managing and building and build-in transform options
+ Modeling support, build-in architecture backbone
+ Evaluation pipeline managing
+ Target structure managing and build-in structures
+ Versatile solver customization options, all optimizers and learn rate schedulers in PyTorch are available in torchlearning-benchmark
+ Learning pipeline managing, logging support and tensorboard support
+ Checkpointing of learning, for both models and optimizers.
+ Configuration system
